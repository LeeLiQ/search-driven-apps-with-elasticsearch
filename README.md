# Building Search Driven Apps with Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch is a highly scalable and feature-rich search engine that makes certain types of problems very easy to solve.

This repository contains three (okay, two - but the third is comign soon!) different apps that take advantage of Elasticsearch's capabilities to do really cool things. It's all about using the right tool for the job!

```cd boardgames && docker-compose up```

## Podcasts
